### Create Binary String:


This C++ program calculates the **maximum number of coins** that can be earned by assigning a binary string of length `N` (consisting of `0`s and `1`s), based on certain rules. Let's walk through the logic.

### ðŸ”§ **Inputs:**

* `T` â€” Number of test cases.
  For each test case:
* `N` â€” Length of the binary string.
* `A` â€” Coins for each `0`.
* `B` â€” Coins for each `1`.
* `C` â€” Coins for each `0-1` pair.
* `D` â€” Coins for each `1-0` pair.

---

### ðŸ§  **Idea:**

For a string of length `N`, you can vary the number of `0`s from `0` to `N`. For each such count:

* Number of `1`s = `N - number_of_zeros`.

For each configuration, the total coin count is calculated using two possible interaction patterns:

1. Assuming all `0-1` pairs (rewarded with `C` coins).
2. Assuming all `1-0` pairs (rewarded with `D` coins).

Since the actual order of the string isn't specified, and you don't know whether there are more `0-1` or `1-0` transitions, the code **takes the maximum of the two** interaction rewards.

### ðŸ“Š **Calculation:**

For each possible `zeros` count:

```cpp
int ones = N - zeros;
val1 = zeros * A + ones * B + zeros * ones * C; // 0-1 interactions
val2 = zeros * A + ones * B + zeros * ones * D; // 1-0 interactions
curr = max(val1, val2);
```

Then it keeps track of the maximum value over all combinations.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Goal:**

Output the **maximum number of coins** that can be achieved for each test case by choosing the best `0`/`1` count combination and best interaction type (`C` or `D`).
